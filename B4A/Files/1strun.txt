Do you want to check for updates? This is done at the app's Github repo.
If updates are available, you will be notified and then you can then download and install the APKs directly from the settings menu.
If you originally installed the app from a repository that performs extra checks/screenings (like IzzyOnDroid), please be aware that those screenings would then be bypassed.

Turn on the checkbox at the bottom of this screen to allow checking for updates.
